# 2i Coding Test
## Iterator

Iterates in multiples of A until X, then in multiples of A + 1 until 2X, then multiples of A + 2 until 3X. 

Each of the iterations required are in a list, showing the values of A at each iteration of iterate().

These lists are then combined into a list of lists showing the full result. See the test class for an example.
